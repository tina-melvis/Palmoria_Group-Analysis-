PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project presents a HR analytics case study for Palmoria Group, a Nigerian manufacturing company facing gender inequality challenges across its 3 regions. The analysis was conducted to provide actionable insights to management regarding gender distribution, pay equity, and compliance with minimum wage regulations.

KEY QUESTIONS ADDRESSED:

What is the gender distribution across the organization by regions and departments?
Are there insights on performance ratings based on gender?
Is there evidence of gender pay gaps, and which departments/regions require focus?
Does Palmoria meet the ₦90,000 minimum wage requirement?
How are employees distributed across salary bands (₦10,000 increments)?

TOOLS USED
Microsoft Power BI - Primary analytics and visualization platform
Power Query - Data transformation and cleaning
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) - Custom calculations and measures

KEY FINDINGS
Major Compliance Issue: 57.6% of employees (543 people) earn below the ₦90,000 minimum wage requirement 
Gender Pay Gaps: While overall balance is good (49% male, 47% female), three departments show concerning gaps: Legal (6.15%), Support (6.46%), and Product Management (7.00%) favoring males. Some departments (Engineering, Marketing, Training) actually favor females

KEY NUMBERS
943 total employees across 3 regions
Only 400 employees meet minimum wage requirement
Overall pay gap: 3.57% favoring males
Performance concern: 212 employees rated "average"

RECOMMENDATIONS 
Emergency salary review for regulatory compliance

Target pay equity fixes in 3 specific departments

Improve performance management system

SUMMARY  
While gender distribution is balanced, Palmoria faces serious minimum wage compliance issues and selective pay gaps that need urgent management attention to avoid regulatory penalties and reputation damage.
